\section{Results}
Based on the given \verb|run.py| I graphed two graphs. Figure
\ref{fig:origtime} and \ref{fig:origcorrect} is based on the output of
\verb|run.py|. We are trying to show that with ``restrictive'' isolation levels
- nearing on complete serialized with Repeatable read - you sacrifice
performance but gain correctness.

  \includegraphics[width=10cm]{origtime}
  \caption[Average time over 5 runs]{Average time over 5 runs as a function of
  swap-threads for both Cursor Stability(CS) and Repeatable Read(RR) isolation levels.\\
  We would expect to non-neglible difference between CS and RR but to me it is
  not conclusive in this graph. The runtime is improved on increased parallelism
  for both isolation levels}\label{fig:origtime}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:origtime} shows the average runtime(y-axis) for 5 runs by run.py for
each level of concurrency (x-axis).
